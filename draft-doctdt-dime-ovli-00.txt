Internet-Draft         Dimeter Overload Indication           August 2013


1.  Introduction

   ...

   We also need to describe carefully what is in the scope of this
   document and what is left for the future documents.  Maybe this
   deserves a new subsection?


2.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   ...


3.  Solution Overview

3.1.  Architectural Assumptions

   Describe here on what basis the solution is intended to work.  This
   lists things like piggybacking, end-to-end semantics, role of
   Diameter agents, etc.

3.2.  Clarifications to Diameter Base Protocol

   Describe here, assuming there is a need, what parts of the existing
   Diameter Base Protocol [RFC6733] needs clarification in the even of
   the overload condition.

3.3.  Dissemination of the Overload Indication

   Explain, e.g. the piggybacking of Overload Indication AVPs in this
   section.  Explain how possible feature negotiation is done?

3.3.1.  Negotiation and Versioning

3.3.2.  Transmission of the Attribute Value Pairs

3.4.  Overload Condition Indication

   Describe here what the overload condition indication is about.


4.  Attribute Value Pairs

   This section describes the encoding and semantics of Overload
   Indication Attribute Value Pairs (AVPs).

4.1.  xyz AVP

   ...

4.2.  abc AVP

   ...

4.3.  Attribute Value Pair flag rules

                                                       +---------+
                                                       |AVP flag |
                                                       |rules    |

   +---------------------------------------------------+----+----+


5.  Transport Considerations

   If anything needs to be said beyond what has been defined in
   Section 3.3.  One candidate is, e.g. the use of SCTP Payload Protocol
   Identifier (PPID).  Also one might spend some more time discussion
   the implications of agents between the "client" and the "server".


6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  AVP codes

   New AVPs defined by this specification are listed in Section 4.  All
   AVP codes allocated from the 'Authentication, Authorization, and
   Accounting (AAA) Parameters' AVP Codes registry.

6.2.  Result-Code values

   This specification adds...:

   AVP Values | Attribute Name                | Reference
   -----------+-------------------------------+----------
    5xxx      | DIAMETER_xx                   | RFCxxxx
    5xxx      | DIAMETER_xx                   | RFCxxxx
    5xxx      | DIAMETER_xx                   | RFCxxxx

6.3.  New registries

   XYZ new registries are needed under the 'Authentication,
   Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) Parameters' registry:

   o  aaa.
   o  bbb.
   o  ccc.


7.  Security Considerations

   No end to end security.  We need to live with that.

Appendix A.  Examples

A.1.  3GPP S6a interface overload indication

   Would cover S6a MME-HSS communication with several topology choices
   (such as with or without DRA, and with "generic" agents).

A.2.  3GPP PCC interfaces overload indication

   Would cover Gx/Rx and maybe S9..
